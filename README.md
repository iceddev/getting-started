Making Coffee at Iced Dev
================
In essence making coffee at Iced Dev is an art more than a function of the day.  Every day should begin with coffee.  Obviously the best way to start your day is to drive down the road to 105 W. Main St, and buy a nice hot steaming cup of joe from Sam at [Lo Fi Coffee](http://www.loficoffee.com "Lo Fi Coffee").

If you can't, and you're in a rush to do work, then it's time to make a Chemex!

Brewing With Chemex
------

Chemex is a great way to create a high caffienation carafe of coffee.  Typically for a chemex you want your grind to be approximate drip.  The fine folks over at [Stumptown Coffee](http://stumptowncoffee.com "Stump Town Coffee") recommend the grind be as fine as kosher salt.  You will want to grind approximately 42 grams(6 spoonfuls if you're using the Chemex scoop).

The second step is lining the filter into the Chemex.  When you are putting the filter on you want to make sure that it stays flush to the chemex to ensure that no channeling takes place.  The next step is pouring some hot water onto the filter and letting it drain into the bottom of the Chemex.  The reason we do this is to both flush the filter of any impurities, and also to ut some hot water into the vessel and prepare it to receive extracted coffee properly.

The third step is to pour our 42 grams of coffee into the chemex filter, and rest them.  You can rest the grounds by giving the chemex a "tiny" shake.

**Blooming the water** When blooming the grounds you want to pour approximately 3oz's of water onto the coffee.  If you wait 30 seconds you will see the coffee begin to "bloom".  Once blooming has finished it's time to get to the meat & potatoes".

**Making the Pour**  This process comes in a 4 minute cycle.  Making the pour can take a lot of failed attempts when trying to get it right.  Don't worry and don't waste coffee!  Slug down your shitty brew like the champion you are for a few days and learn how to tweak the recipe to what you like!  Start by pouring 7oz of water over the coffee using a slow, but smooth figure 8 motions.  You can also trace a 6 pointed star if you want to get fancy on this.  *Don't* pour directly onto the filter as this will create channeling.  Wait until 3:20 on your timer, and then pour another 30oz of water into the chemex!  

That's it!

Drink Definitions
----
* Espresso - An espresso is a small 24-34g(1-1.5 oz) drink pulled at 9 barometric pressures through finely ground coffee for 20-30 seconds.  It's really strong and badass.  If you're a badass....you drink this.  Use the espresso to supplement a cup of coffee in the mornings if you have a high level of immunity to caffeine
* Macchiato - A macchiato is simply a 50/50 concoction of espresso and steamed milk.  When we say macchiato, this is a good post-11AM drink that youg get as a quick pick me up.  
* Cortado - The cortado is in essence a mini latte.  Think about ratios here.  The cortado is 5oz's:  2 parts espresso, 2 parts steamed milk, 1 part foam.  This is a good one to have with with a small pastry.  Always get a cortado when you get a pastry and if you have a small appetite.
* Cappuccino - The MOAD(mother of all drinks).  It's 6 oz and appropriate really any time of day.  This is an all day, 'errr' day drink.  It's the drink of evens.  2 parts esprsso, 2 parts steamed milk, 2 parts foam.  It's served in a dainty glass, and if you order it to go...you're a tool, and doing it wrong.
* Latte - Another evens drink.  This drink is upgraded to 8oz's so your taste level of espresso is actually going to be minimal.  This is where we can actually start to substitute flavors, but give up steamed milk, and add calories.  Lattes are good if you're not feeling to acidic about a full cup of coffee.  Do this is your tummy is feeling rumbly.  It's also great with a biscotti.
* Stupid Lattes - Stupid lattes have syrups, and that's disgusting.  Never order a drink with flavors, it's lame.  Enjoy the coffee, not the sugar.  Properly steamed milk should have natural sweetness, and the coffee should have its own unique flavor.
* Shitty Iced Drinks - Iced drinks technically are just proportional to their latte counter parts.  The generic term really for anything iced is a "iced latte".  Personally i'm not a huge fan of them, but if that's cool, do your think.  I think it's okay to drink an iced latte with flavor.s
